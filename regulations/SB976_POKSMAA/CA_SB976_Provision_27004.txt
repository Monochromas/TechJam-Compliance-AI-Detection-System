27004. (a) An operator may choose not to provide services to minors. However, the operator of an addictive internet-based service or application shall not withhold, degrade, lower the quality of, or increase the price of, any product, service, or feature, other than as required by this chapter, due to a user or parent availing themselves of the rights provided by this chapter, or due to the protections required by this chapter.
(b) A parentâ€™s provision of consent as described in Section 27001 or 27002, or the use by a parent of a mechanism as described in Section 27002, does not waive, release, otherwise limit, or serve as a defense to, any claim that the parent, or that the user who is a minor or was a minor at the time of using the internet-based service or application, might have against the operator of an addictive internet-based service or application regarding any harm to the mental health or well-being of the user.
(c) The protections provided by this chapter are in addition to those provided by any other applicable law, including, but not limited to, the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act (Title 1.81.47 (commencing with Section 1798.99.28) of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code).
