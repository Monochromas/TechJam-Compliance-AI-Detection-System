Statement: This section mandates that social media companies must use an approved age assurance system to verify the age of new account holders.
Context: This provision is the core of the bill's age verification requirement. It prohibits social media services from allowing a Utah minor account holder to create a new account without using an approved age assurance system and a verifiable parental consent mechanism. It also outlines the process for a minor to appeal an age verification result.

Section 2. Section 13-71-201 is enacted to read:
Part 2. Minor Protection
13-71-201. Age assurance and age verification requirements.
(1) A social media company may not allow a Utah minor account holder to create a new account on the social media service unless the social media company:
(a) has confirmed the Utah minor account holder's age by using a reliable age assurance system; and
(b) if the Utah account holder is a minor, has obtained verifiable parental consent to the minor account holder's use of the social media service.
(2) (a) A social media company that complies with a verified age assurance system or verifiable parental consent mechanism that is approved by the Division of Consumer Protection in accordance with a rule made under Section 13-71-302 is entitled to the affirmative defense under Section 13-71-302.
(b) A social media company that uses an age assurance system or verifiable parental consent mechanism that is not approved by the Division of Consumer Protection under a rule made under Section 13-71-302 is not entitled to the affirmative defense.
(3) The social media company shall provide a minor with a method to appeal a decision that the minor is not of the age for which the minor sought to verify.
