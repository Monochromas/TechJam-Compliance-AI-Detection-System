A third party that performs age verification for a commercial entity in violation of s. 501.1738 is deemed to have committed an unfair and deceptive trade practice actionable under part II of this chapter solely by the department against such third party.

If the department has reason to believe that the third party is in violation of s. 501.1738, the department, as the enforcing authority, may bring an action against such third party for an unfair or deceptive act or practice.

For the purpose of bringing an action pursuant to this section, ss. 501.211 and 501.212 do not apply. In addition to other remedies under part II of this chapter, the department may collect a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation and reasonable attorney fees and court costs.
