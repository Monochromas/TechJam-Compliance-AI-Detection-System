Any violation of subsection (2) or subsection (3) is deemed an unfair and deceptive trade practice actionable under part II of this chapter solely by the department on behalf of a resident minor against a commercial entity.

If the department has reason to believe that a commercial entity is in violation of subsection (2) or subsection (3), the department, as the enforcing authority, may bring an action against the commercial entity for an unfair or deceptive act or practice.

For the purpose of bringing an action pursuant to this section, ss. 501.211 and 501.212 do not apply. In addition to any other remedy under part II of this chapter, the department may collect a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation and reasonable attorney fees and court costs.

When the commercial entity's failure to comply with subsection (2) or subsection (3) is a consistent pattern of conduct of the commercial entity, punitive damages may be assessed against the commercial entity.
