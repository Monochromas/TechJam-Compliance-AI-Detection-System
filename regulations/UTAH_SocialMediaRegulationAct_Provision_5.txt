Statement: This section describes the affirmative defense available to a social media company to protect itself from a lawsuit brought under the Act.
Context: A company can gain a favorable rebuttable presumption in court if it can prove that it has implemented specific restrictions for minors' accounts, including usage time limits, nighttime access restrictions, parental consent requirements, and the disabling of engagement-driven design features.

Section 5. Section 78B-3-1104 is enacted to read:
78B-3-1104. Affirmative defense.
(1) A person is not entitled to the rebuttable presumption described in Subsection 78B-11-1103(3), and a social media company is entitled to the rebuttable presumption described in Subsection 78B-11-1103(4), if the social media company demonstrates to the court that the social media company:
(a) limits a Utah minor account holder's use of the algorithmically curated social media service to no more than three hours in a 24 hour period across all devices;
(b) restricts a Utah minor account holder from accessing the algorithmically curated social media service between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m.;
(c) requires the parent or legal guardian of the minor to consent to a Utah minor account holder's use of the algorithmically curated social media service; and
(d) disables engagement driven design elements for a Utah minor account holder's account.
(2) A social media company may utilize settings that are enabled at the device level to impose the requirements described in Subsection (1).
(3) Notwithstanding Subsection (2), a social media company remains liable to ensure that the Utah minor account holder's account is subject to the restrictions of Subsection (1).
